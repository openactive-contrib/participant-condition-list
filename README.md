See further the originating [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/241) for the vocabulary.

## Contributing

If you wish to propose changes to this taxonomy, please make the changes you wish to see to the participant-condition-supported.jsonld file and then open a PR to integrate them.

Because the taxonomy is still a working draft, broad changes to its structure and members remain possible. However, please ensure that:

* identifier conventions are respected. IDs for concepts **must** be of the form `https://disability.openactive.io/participant-condition-supported#{UUID}`
* While Concepts may be moved around the hierarchy or relabelled, they must not be deleted once added, unless they do not respect the above identifier convention
* Do not change identifier values once assigned
